This system includes compulsory general education (kindergartens and schools) and professional education (colleges, technical schools, universities). In turn, professional education is divided into secondary and higher education. Professional development and retraining programs are considered the final educational stage.\n\nBachelor's and Specialist's degrees\n\nRussia has adopted the Bologna Process, which is a three-cycle educational system consisting of an undergraduate degree (4 years) and a Master's degree (2 years) During their Bachelor's degree, students gain a broad understanding of their chosen specialty, with the opportunity to explore various areas of interest. Graduates with a Bachelor's degree can immediately begin working in their chosen profession, or they can continue their studies at the next level. Additionally, some universities still offer specialist programs, a level that only exists in Russia. Specialist programs provide a more focused education over 5\u20136 years that emphasizes practical skills.\n\nMaster's degree\n\nThe Master's Degree is the second stage of higher education in the Bologna Process. To be admitted into a Master's program, applicants must have a Bachelor's or Specialist's degree. These programs are generally more research-oriented, providing students with an in-depth understanding of their chosen subject. Master's programs usually last two years and focus mainly on the Student's ability to independently grasp the material.\n\nPostgraduate program\n\nPostgraduate programs are mainly for training research and teaching personnel. To be admitted into a postgraduate program, applicants must have a Master's or Specialist's Degree. These programs include educational aspects, pedagogical and practical work, and research. Graduate students must choose a scientific area and research topic for their dissertation. In-person, full-time programs are at least 3 years, while part-time programs are at least 4. At the end of the program, successful candidates receive a postgraduate diploma with a qualification (\"Researcher\", \"Research Teacher\"). After defending their dissertation, graduate students are awarded a Candidate of Science degree, which is the first of two doctoral-level scientific degrees. Candidates of Sciences are then eligible for the Doctor of Sciences degree (the second doctoral-level scientific degree), which is awarded following the defense of a doctoral dissertation.\n\n For more information, visit the Education in Russia web page.\n\nWhat is the Point-Grade System (\u0411\u0420\u0421)?\nThe Point-Grade System is a digital mark for evaluating students' learning activities and achievements. The Point-Grade System is a system for determining the level of student success based on the cumulative principle of assessing academic performance and its results.\n\nWhen do lectures begin and finish?\nAll the information about dates can be found here."}
